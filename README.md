# Python Data Analysis Libraries Projects
<br />***Python*** has efficient high-level data structures and effective object-oriented programming. Thanks to elegant syntax, dynamic typing and interpreted nature, it is an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas. 
<br />A few Python's libraries were used in these projects, for example:
<br />1. **NumPy** is the fundamental package for scientific computing. It provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects, an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays.
<br />2. **pandas** is a open source data analysis and manipulation tool.
<br />3. **Matplotlib** is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
<br />4. **Seaborn** is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

<br />This repository is made up of four projects.
<br />All descriptions are related to these projects are included in each folder.
